Projet 2 2023

The aim of this project was to modelise the propagation of a virus in a certain type of populations. 

The population mainly come from companies (different sizes) and schools. (Where virus like Covid-19 mainly spread)

I used datas and some hypothesis coming from an article on the covid-19 crisis.

The explaination of the function is written in french directly in the code.
